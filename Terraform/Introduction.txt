IAC or Infrastructure as Code - The better way to provision cloud infra is to codify the entire provisioning process.This way we can write and execute code to define, provision, configure, update , and eventually destroy infra resources.
With this yoy can manage any infra component as code, such as databases,networks,storage,or even application configuration.

Some IAC Tools: Ansible, Terraform, Puppet, CloudFormation, Packer, SaltStack, Vagrant, Docker,etc.

IAC can be categorized in three types: 
1. Configuration Management -Ansible, Puppet, SaltStack
  - Designed to Install and Manage Software
  - Maintaines Standard Structure
  - Version Control
  - Idempotent : This means you can run the code multiple time and every time you run it, it'll only make the changes that are necessary to bring the environment into a defined state.
2. Server Templating - Docker, Packer, Vagrant
  - pre Installed software and dependencies
  - Virtual Machine or Docker Images
  - Imuutable Infrastructure
3. Infrastructure Provisioning - Terraform and CloudFormation
  - Deploy Immutable Infrastructure resources
  - Servers, Databases, Network Componenets,etc
  - Multiple Providers.


Terraform - is a free and open-source tool developed by HashiCorp.
It installs as a single binary which can be set up very quickly, allowing us to build, manage and destroy infra in a matter of minutes.
it is basically used as an infrastructure provisioning tool.
It uses HCL(HashiCorp Configuration Language) which is a simple declarative language to define the infra resources to be provisioned as blocks of code. All infra resources can be defined within configuration files that have a .tf extension.




Advantages: deploy Infra across multiple platform, including private and public cloud sucha as on-premises vSpher Cluster or cloud solutions such as AWS,GCP,Azure,etc.

Provider- A provider helps Terraform manage third-party platform through their API.
Tools through provider support.
network infra tools like F5 BIG-IP, CLoudflare,DNS, Palo ALto Networks and Inflobox
Monitoring and Data management tool: Datadog,Grafana,Auth0,wavefront, and Sumo Logic.
Databases: Mongo DB,InfluxDB,MySQL,PostgreSQL and version control systems like Github,Bitbucket or Gitlab.
