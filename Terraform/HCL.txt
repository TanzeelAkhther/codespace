Terraform uses configuration files which  are written in HCL to deploy infra resources.

What is a resource?
A resource is an object data for managers. It could be a file on a local host or it could be aVM on the cloud such as EC2 instance.
It could be services like S3 buckets, ECS, DynamoDB tables, IM users, IM groups, rules, policies, etc

Local file type of resource and a special kind of resource callled a "random pit"

HCL- HashiCorp Configuration Language.

HCL syntax
<block> <parameters> {
  key1 = value1
  key2 = value2
}
Example:
resource "local_file" "pet" {        #resource-block name    #"local_file"-Resource Type(local=provider,file=resource)    #pet - Resource name
  filename = "/root/pets.text"    /*Arguments
  content = "We love pets"         */
}
block-containes a set of arguments in key value pair format representing the configuration data.
 or A block in terraform contains information abouth the infra platform and a set of resources within that platform that we want to create.

Example of a resource file created fro provisionin an AWS EC2 Instance:

resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {
  ami = ".........."
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

terraform show-This command inspects the state file and displays the resource details.

Immutable Infrastructure- Even when the change we made is trivial, Terraform will delete the old file and then create a new file with the update configurations.This type of infra is called an Imuutable infra.
