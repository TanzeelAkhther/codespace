CMD - which stands for Command that defines the program that will run within the container.

Containers are meant to run a specific task or process such as to host an instance of a web server, or application server..
Once the task is complete, the container exits.

Bash is not really a process like a web server or database server. It is a shell that listens for insput from a terminal if it cannot find the terminal, it exits.

By default, docker does not attach a terminal to a container when it is run
