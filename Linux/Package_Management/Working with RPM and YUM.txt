The RPM database stores info about all RPM package installed in your system.It is stored in the /war/lib/rpm directory. It is used to query what packages are installed.

NOTE: RPM does not resolve package dependencies on its own hence we make use of a higher-level package manager called YUM.

YUM - Yellowdog Updater Modified, and it is a free and open-source package Manager that works on RPM based linux system. It works with software repo which are essentially a collections of packages and provides packages and dependency management on RPM based distros.
The repo info is store in the /etc/yum.respos.d and the repo files have a .repo extension.
ex: /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo
    /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo  Install a nginx package.


YUM commands
Install command : yum install httpd
remove command : yum remove httpd
update command for a specific package : yum update telnet      (package name is telnet)
update all packages: yum update

show all repos added to your system: yum repolist

yum provides scp :- use command name as argument, and we are looking for the package the provided the SCP command using the yum provides command.
